# Inclusion, Belonging, and Psychological Safety

## Introduction

In Sessions 1 and 2, we explored what leadership means to us and how to distinguish between technical problems and adaptive challenges. Now we turn to a fundamental question for outbreak response leadership:

**How do we create teams where everyone can contribute their best work—especially when the stakes are high, information is uncertain, and time is short?**

The answer lies in understanding three interconnected concepts:
- **Diversity is a fact**
- **Inclusion is a behavior**
- **Belonging is the emotional outcome people want**

And crucially, all three depend on **psychological safety**—the belief that you can speak up, ask questions, admit mistakes, and challenge ideas without fear of punishment or humiliation.

As organizational psychologist Amy Edmondson has demonstrated, psychological safety isn't just about being nice. It's about creating the conditions for learning, innovation, and truth-telling in high-stakes environments. In outbreak response, where lives are on the line and situations change rapidly, psychological safety becomes essential.

## The Three-Level Framework

### Level 1: Diversity is a Fact

**Diversity** simply describes differences among people:
- Professional backgrounds (epidemiologists, clinicians, logisticians, communicators)
- Organizational affiliations (WHO, Ministry of Health, NGOs, universities)
- Cultural and national identities
- Languages spoken
- Career stages (junior staff to senior leaders)
- Lived experiences
- Perspectives and approaches

**In outbreak response, diversity is inevitable**. A measles outbreak response team might include:
- Public health officials from multiple jurisdictions
- Healthcare providers from different specialties
- Laboratory scientists
- Communication specialists
- Community leaders
- Data analysts
- Logistics coordinators

**You don't create diversity in outbreak response—it already exists**. The question is what you do with it.

### Level 2: Inclusion is a Behavior

**Inclusion** is the active practice of ensuring that all people—especially those who might be marginalized or overlooked—can fully participate and contribute.

Inclusion asks: **Who is in the room? Who gets to speak? Whose ideas are heard? Who influences decisions?**

#### What Inclusion Looks Like

**Inclusive behaviors**:
- Actively seeking input from quieter team members
- Ensuring meeting times accommodate different time zones
- Providing information in multiple languages when needed
- Creating multiple ways to contribute (not just speaking in large meetings)
- Acknowledging contributions from all levels
- Challenging interruptions and talking-over
- Distributing leadership opportunities

**Exclusive behaviors** (often unintentional):
- Only calling on senior people or those from certain organizations
- Scheduling important meetings when some team members can't attend
- Moving too quickly for non-native speakers to contribute
- Rewarding confidence over substance
- Allowing dominant voices to monopolize discussions
- Making decisions in informal conversations that exclude some members

## Critical Insight

Inclusion is something **leaders do**. It's not passive. It requires conscious, repeated actions to create space for all voices.
:::

### Level 3: Belonging is the Emotional Outcome

**Belonging** is the feeling that you are valued, respected, and essential to the team—that you can be yourself and still fit in.

When people feel they belong:
- They contribute their full energy and creativity
- They speak up with concerns and ideas
- They ask for help when needed
- They stay engaged during difficult times
- They bring their authentic selves to work

When people don't feel they belong:
- They hold back their best ideas
- They stay silent when they see problems
- They go through the motions
- They leave (physically or mentally)

**You cannot mandate belonging**. Leaders create it through consistent inclusive behaviors over time. Belonging is the outcome when inclusion becomes the team's norm.

## Psychological Safety: The Foundation

Harvard professor Amy Edmondson has spent decades studying what enables teams to learn, innovate, and perform in high-stakes environments. Her research consistently points to one factor: **psychological safety**.

### What is Psychological Safety?

**Psychological safety** is the belief that you won't be punished or humiliated for:
- Speaking up with questions, concerns, or ideas
- Admitting mistakes or gaps in knowledge
- Challenging current plans or assumptions
- Reporting bad news or failures
- Asking for help

::: {.callout-note}
## What Psychological Safety Is NOT

Psychological safety is **not**:
- Being nice all the time
- Avoiding difficult conversations
- Lowering standards or expectations
- Protecting people from accountability
- Creating comfort zones

It **is** about making it safe to be honest, especially about difficult things.
:::

### Why Psychological Safety Matters in Outbreak Response

Outbreak response combines everything that makes psychological safety essential:

**High stakes**:
- Lives depend on decisions
- Public trust is fragile
- Political pressure is intense
- Media scrutiny is constant

**Uncertainty**:
- Information is incomplete
- Situations change rapidly
- "Right" answers aren't always clear
- New problems emerge constantly

**Interdependence**:
- No one person or organization has all the answers
- Success requires coordination across boundaries
- Mistakes in one area affect others
- Learning must happen rapidly

In this environment, **teams need people to speak up**:
- "I don't understand the data."
- "This approach isn't working in the field."
- "I made a mistake in the case count."
- "The community doesn't trust us."
- "I need help with this task."

**Without psychological safety, people stay silent**. And silence in outbreak response can be deadly.

## The Cost of Low Psychological Safety

### What Happens When Teams Lack Psychological Safety

#### 1. Mistakes Stay Hidden

A data analyst notices something odd in the case numbers but fears looking incompetent if they're wrong. They stay quiet. The error compounds.

#### 2. Bad News Travels Slowly

Field teams know a strategy isn't working, but leadership seems committed to it. They don't want to be seen as negative or unsupportive. By the time leadership learns the truth, valuable time is lost.

#### 3. Junior Staff Stay Silent

A young epidemiologist sees a pattern that more senior colleagues might have missed, but doesn't feel their perspective will be valued. The insight is never shared.

#### 4. Cross-Organization Friction Grows

Team members fear criticizing approaches from partner organizations. Problems in coordination go unaddressed, resentment builds, and collaboration suffers.

#### 5. Innovation Stops

People stick to "the way we've always done it" because suggesting new approaches feels risky.

### A Real-World Example

During a cholera outbreak, a community health worker noticed that people were avoiding treatment centers despite education campaigns. She suspected it was because families feared forced separation and stigma, but she didn't feel comfortable raising this with the international experts running the response.

By the time leadership understood the problem, transmission had continued for weeks unnecessarily. When they finally redesigned the approach to allow families to stay together and reduced visible security measures, treatment-seeking behavior changed rapidly.

**The information was available early—but psychological safety wasn't present for it to surface.**

## Building Psychological Safety: Leader Behaviors

Edmondson's research identifies specific behaviors leaders can practice to build psychological safety. In outbreak response, these become even more critical.

### 1. Frame the Work as a Learning Problem

**Instead of**: "We know what to do; we just need to execute."

**Try**: "We're dealing with uncertainty. We'll need to learn and adjust as we go."

**Why it matters**: This frames mistakes and questions as normal parts of the work, not failures.

**In practice**:
- "This is a new situation. We'll learn things we didn't expect."
- "Our first approach might not be perfect. We'll need your observations from the field."
- "There's a lot we don't know yet. Questions and concerns will help us learn faster."

### 2. Acknowledge Your Own Fallibility

**Instead of**: Projecting certainty and having all the answers.

**Try**: Being transparent about what you don't know.

**Why it matters**: If the leader can admit uncertainty, others feel safer doing so.

**In practice**:
- "I don't know the answer to that. Let's figure it out together."
- "I might be wrong about this. What are you seeing?"
- "I'm uncertain about the best path forward here."
- "I made an assumption that turned out to be incorrect."

::: {.callout-tip}
## Power of Leader Vulnerability

When leaders model fallibility, they give permission for others to be honest about their own uncertainty. This doesn't undermine authority—it builds trust.
:::

### 3. Ask Questions—Lots of Them

**Instead of**: Providing answers and direction.

**Try**: Asking genuine questions that invite input.

**Why it matters**: Questions signal that you value others' perspectives and that their input influences decisions.

**In practice**:
- "What are you seeing in the field that we might not see from headquarters?"
- "What could go wrong with this approach?"
- "What am I missing?"
- "Who else should we be hearing from on this?"
- "What concerns do you have about this plan?"

### 4. Respond Productively to Bad News and Mistakes

**This is the most critical behavior**. How you respond when someone brings bad news or admits a mistake determines whether others will do the same.

**Unproductive responses** (shut down psychological safety):
- Blame: "Why did you let this happen?"
- Defensiveness: "That's not true; the plan is sound."
- Dismissal: "That's not a real problem."
- Shooting the messenger: "You should have prevented this."

**Productive responses** (build psychological safety):
- Curiosity: "Tell me more about what you're seeing."
- Appreciation: "Thank you for bringing this to my attention."
- Problem-solving: "What do we need to do now?"
- Learning focus: "What can we learn from this?"

**In practice**:

*Scenario 1: A mistake*
- Staff: "I made an error in yesterday's situation report. The case count was overstated."
- Unproductive: "This is unacceptable. We can't have errors in our official reports!"
- Productive: "Thank you for catching this and telling me. Let's issue a correction and think about how to prevent similar errors going forward."

*Scenario 2: Bad news*
- Staff: "The community meeting didn't go well. There's a lot of distrust we didn't anticipate."
- Unproductive: "We briefed you on messaging. What went wrong?"
- Productive: "Tell me what happened. What are people concerned about? What did we miss in our planning?"

### 5. Create Structures for Input

Don't just rely on spontaneous speaking up. Build structured opportunities for all voices.

**Examples**:
- **Round-robin check-ins**: Everyone shares one observation or concern
- **Anonymous input channels**: Surveys or question boxes for sensitive issues
- **Small group discussions**: Before large meetings, give people time to discuss in pairs or small groups
- **Designated devil's advocate**: Assign someone to challenge assumptions
- **After-action reviews**: Regular structured reflection on what's working and what isn't

### 6. Be Inclusively Vigilant

Pay attention to who's speaking and who's not:
- "We haven't heard from the field team yet. What's your perspective?"
- "Let's hear from someone who hasn't spoken yet."
- Interrupt interrupters: "Hold on, I want to hear the rest of what Maria was saying."

Notice patterns:
- Are some groups consistently left out?
- Are junior staff silent in meetings?
- Do people from certain organizations dominate?

## Practical Strategies for Outbreak Response Teams

### Strategy 1: Establish Psychological Safety Norms Early

When forming an outbreak response team, explicitly establish norms:

**Example opening statement**:
> "We're going to be working under pressure with incomplete information. We need everyone's best thinking. That means it needs to be safe to:
> - Ask questions when something doesn't make sense
> - Raise concerns about our plans
> - Admit when you don't know something
> - Report problems or mistakes early
> - Challenge assumptions, including mine
>
> If you see something that concerns you, speak up. If you make a mistake, tell us quickly so we can address it. This is how we'll learn fast enough to be effective."

### Strategy 2: Daily Check-ins with Psychological Safety Focus

Start daily briefings with a psychological safety prompt:
- "What's one thing that's not going as planned?"
- "What are you worried about today?"
- "What questions do you have that you're hesitant to ask?"
- "Where do we need to adjust our approach?"

### Strategy 3: Model Learning from Failure

When things go wrong (and they will), respond with learning:

**After-action conversations**:
1. What was supposed to happen?
2. What actually happened?
3. Why was there a difference?
4. What will we do differently?

**Critical**: Focus on systems and learning, not on blame.

### Strategy 4: Create Diverse Decision-Making Groups

Don't let decisions get made only by:
- The most senior people
- One professional discipline
- One organization
- The loudest voices

Actively include:
- Field staff with ground-level perspective
- Different technical expertises
- Junior staff with fresh eyes
- Community representatives

### Strategy 5: Separate Idea Generation from Evaluation

When brainstorming solutions:
1. **First**: Generate ideas without critique ("What are all the possible approaches?")
2. **Then**: Evaluate them ("What are the pros and cons of each?")

Don't combine these steps. Criticism during generation kills psychological safety and reduces creativity.

### Strategy 6: Thank People for Difficult Contributions

Explicitly appreciate:
- Questions that reveal problems in the plan
- Admissions of mistakes
- Challenges to current approaches
- Bad news delivered early

**Example**: "I appreciate you raising this concern. This is exactly the kind of input we need to make good decisions."

## Measuring Psychological Safety on Your Team

Use these questions to assess psychological safety (adapted from Edmondson):

::: {.callout-note}
## Team Psychological Safety Assessment

For your outbreak response team, how much do you agree with these statements?

1. If you make a mistake on this team, it is often held against you. (Reverse scored)
2. Members of this team are able to bring up problems and tough issues.
3. People on this team sometimes reject others for being different. (Reverse scored)
4. It is safe to take a risk on this team.
5. It is difficult to ask other members of this team for help. (Reverse scored)
6. No one on this team would deliberately act in a way that undermines my efforts.
7. Working with members of this team, my unique skills and talents are valued and utilized.

**High psychological safety**: Most statements rated "agree" or "strongly agree" (reversing items 1, 3, 5)

**Low psychological safety**: Many statements rated "disagree" or "strongly disagree"
:::

You can also observe behavioral indicators:
- Do people ask questions in meetings?
- Do people admit uncertainty or mistakes?
- Do junior staff speak up?
- Is there laughter and lightness even during serious work?
- Do people challenge ideas (including yours) constructively?

## Common Barriers and How to Address Them

### Barrier 1: "We don't have time for this—it's an emergency!"

**Reality**: Psychological safety **saves** time in emergencies.

Without it, you waste time:
- Pursuing approaches that aren't working because no one spoke up
- Fixing mistakes that could have been caught earlier
- Rebuilding trust after relationships break down
- Making decisions with incomplete information

With it, you:
- Learn and adapt faster
- Catch problems early
- Make better decisions with better information
- Maintain team functioning under stress

**Response**: "Psychological safety isn't a luxury—it's how we learn fast enough to be effective."

### Barrier 2: "Some people are just naturally quiet"

**Reality**: People are often quiet because they've learned it's not safe to speak.

- Have you explicitly invited their input?
- Have you created structures that don't require speaking in large groups?
- Have you responded well when they do speak?
- Does your team culture value listening as much as speaking?

**Response**: Create multiple ways to contribute—writing, small groups, one-on-one conversations.

### Barrier 3: "I can't show uncertainty—people need me to be confident"

**Reality**: People need you to be trustworthy more than they need you to be certain.

False confidence:
- Leads to decisions based on incomplete information
- Prevents others from sharing what they know
- Erodes trust when predictions don't match reality

Honest uncertainty:
- Invites collaboration in problem-solving
- Surfaces information you don't have
- Builds trust through authenticity

**Response**: "I can be confident in our process and our team while being uncertain about specific answers."

### Barrier 4: "Psychological safety means lowering standards"

**Reality**: Psychological safety enables **higher** standards.

Without psychological safety:
- Mistakes stay hidden and repeat
- Problems aren't addressed
- Mediocre work goes unchallenged

With psychological safety:
- Mistakes are caught and corrected
- Problems are addressed early
- Work is improved through honest feedback

**Response**: "Psychological safety means we can hold each other to high standards because we're all committed to the mission, not to protecting our egos."

## The Connection to Inclusion and Belonging

Psychological safety, inclusion, and belonging reinforce each other:

**Psychological safety enables inclusion**:
- When it's safe to speak, more voices contribute
- When differences are valued, diverse perspectives emerge

**Inclusion builds psychological safety**:
- When all voices are actively sought, people trust they'll be heard
- When contributions are valued, people feel safer contributing

**Both create belonging**:
- When you can speak safely and your voice is valued, you feel you belong
- When you belong, you're more likely to speak up, which reinforces psychological safety

## Reflective Exercise: Your Team's Psychological Safety

Think about your current or most recent outbreak response team:

::: {.callout-note}
## Reflection Questions

1. **Assess the current state**:
   - On a scale of 1-10, how psychologically safe is your team?
   - What evidence supports your rating?

2. **Identify critical moments**:
   - Think of a time someone on your team admitted a mistake or shared bad news. How did leadership respond?
   - Think of a time someone stayed silent when they should have spoken up. Why do you think they stayed silent?

3. **Examine your own behavior**:
   - When did you last admit you didn't know something?
   - When did you last ask a question to which you genuinely didn't know the answer?
   - How do you respond when someone brings you bad news?

4. **Consider inclusion**:
   - Who speaks in meetings? Who doesn't?
   - Whose ideas get picked up and developed? Whose get dismissed?
   - Who influences decisions? Who doesn't?

5. **Envision belonging**:
   - Do team members seem energized or exhausted?
   - Do people bring their authentic selves or perform a role?
   - Would people describe feeling essential or expendable?
:::

## Case Study: Two Outbreak Response Teams

### Team A: Low Psychological Safety

**Situation**: Multi-organization response to a measles outbreak

**Dynamics**:
- The incident commander (IC) is confident and directive
- Meetings focus on the IC providing updates and assigning tasks
- Questions are interpreted as challenges to authority
- When a field report contradicts headquarters' understanding, the IC dismisses it as "field staff not seeing the big picture"
- Junior staff whisper concerns in the hallways but stay silent in meetings
- A data error goes uncorrected for three days because the person who noticed it feared looking incompetent

**Outcomes**:
- Vaccination strategies don't adjust to ground realities
- Staff burnout is high
- Information flows poorly
- Learning is slow
- Several staff request reassignment

### Team B: High Psychological Safety

**Situation**: Multi-organization response to a measles outbreak

**Dynamics**:
- The IC opens meetings acknowledging uncertainty: "We're learning as we go."
- Briefings include structured time for concerns and questions
- When a field report contradicts headquarters' understanding, the IC says: "Tell me more. What are you seeing that we're missing?"
- The IC regularly asks: "What am I not asking about that I should be?"
- A data error is caught and corrected within hours because the person who noticed it felt comfortable speaking up immediately
- Decisions are made collaboratively with input from multiple levels and organizations

**Outcomes**:
- Strategies adapt rapidly based on field feedback
- Staff are tired but engaged
- Information flows across the team
- Learning is rapid
- Team cohesion strengthens under pressure

**Same outbreak. Different leadership. Different outcomes.**

The difference? Team B's leader understood that in uncertain, high-stakes situations, psychological safety isn't optional—it's strategic.

## Practical Application

### This Week: Build Psychological Safety

Choose 2-3 practices to implement immediately:

**Morning practices**:
- Start your next team meeting by acknowledging one thing you're uncertain about
- Ask a question to which you genuinely don't know the answer
- Invite input from someone who hasn't spoken

**When someone brings bad news or admits a mistake**:
- Thank them before responding to the content
- Ask questions with genuine curiosity
- Focus on learning and problem-solving, not blame

**In your next decision**:
- Explicitly seek input from different perspectives
- Ask: "What could go wrong with this approach?"
- Acknowledge trade-offs and uncertainties

**Observation practice**:
- Notice who speaks in meetings and who doesn't
- Notice how you respond to challenges or questions
- Notice your own discomfort with uncertainty

### Building Inclusion Habits

**Before the next meeting**:
- Who needs to be there whose voice might not be included?
- How will you ensure quieter members contribute?

**During meetings**:
- Track who's speaking
- Actively invite unheard perspectives
- Interrupt interruptions

**After meetings**:
- Follow up with people who seemed to have something to say but didn't speak
- Ask: "What didn't we discuss that we should have?"

## Conclusion: The Leadership Choice

Diversity is a fact—you don't create it in outbreak response, you work with it.

**Inclusion is a choice**—the daily choice to create space for all voices.

**Belonging is an outcome**—the result of consistently inclusive behavior over time.

**Psychological safety is the foundation**—the essential condition that makes inclusion possible and allows diverse teams to do their best work.

In outbreak response, where uncertainty is high, stakes are elevated, and learning must happen rapidly, psychological safety isn't a nice-to-have. It's a strategic necessity.

As Amy Edmondson's research shows, organizations that succeed in high-stakes, uncertain environments are **fearless organizations**—not because they're unafraid, but because they've created the conditions where people can be honest about their fears, uncertainties, and mistakes.

::: {.callout-tip}
## Remember

The question isn't whether your team will face uncertainty and make mistakes during outbreak response. The question is whether your team's psychological safety allows those uncertainties and mistakes to surface quickly enough to learn from them.
:::

## Connection to Previous Sessions

This session builds on our previous work:

**Session 1** taught us that leadership means something different to each person. Creating psychological safety means creating space for those diverse leadership perspectives to emerge.

**Session 2** taught us about adaptive challenges. Building psychological safety **is** an adaptive challenge—it requires people to change deeply held beliefs about vulnerability, mistakes, and authority. You can't solve it with a policy or procedure; you must do the adaptive work.

**Session 3** teaches us that the diverse teams we work with in outbreak response can only reach their potential when inclusion is practiced and psychological safety is present. This is how we create belonging.

## Looking Ahead

In the next session, we'll explore how to lead with incomplete information—a constant reality in outbreak response. Psychological safety will be essential for that work: people must feel safe to say "I don't know" and safe to share partial information without fear of being dismissed.

## Action Items

Before the next session:

1. **Assess psychological safety** on your current team using the questions provided

2. **Identify one practice** from this session to implement this week

3. **Notice your responses**:
   - Next time someone brings bad news, how do you respond?
   - Next time someone asks a question, how do you respond?
   - What opportunities do you have to model fallibility?

4. **Have one conversation** about psychological safety with your team:
   - "How safe is it to speak up on our team?"
   - "What would make it safer?"
   - "What am I doing that helps or hinders psychological safety?"

5. **Observe inclusion patterns**:
   - Who speaks in meetings? Who doesn't?
   - Whose ideas get taken up? Whose get dismissed?
   - What can you do to be more inclusively vigilant?
