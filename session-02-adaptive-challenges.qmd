# Adaptive Challenges vs. Technical Problems

## Introduction

In Session 1, we explored what leadership means to each of us. We discovered that leadership is personal and context-dependent, much like a wave—powerful, dynamic, and ever-changing.

Now we turn to a critical distinction that will shape how you approach leadership during outbreak response: **the difference between technical problems and adaptive challenges**.

This framework, developed by leadership expert Ronald Heifetz, helps explain why some outbreak response efforts succeed while others struggle—even when everyone is working hard and has the right technical expertise.

Understanding this distinction can transform how you lead.

## The Core Distinction

### Technical Problems

**Technical problems** can be solved with existing knowledge, skills, and procedures. They have:

- **Known solutions**: Experts can provide answers
- **Clear cause and effect**: If we do X, Y will happen
- **Authority can solve them**: Leaders or experts can fix the problem
- **Relatively quick resolution**: Implementation follows a plan
- **No need for people to change**: People just need to follow instructions

#### Examples from Outbreak Response

- Setting up a laboratory testing protocol
- Establishing a quarantine facility
- Creating a contact tracing database
- Ordering personal protective equipment
- Writing a standard operating procedure

These are important, necessary tasks. But they're not the hardest part of outbreak response.

### Adaptive Challenges

**Adaptive challenges** require learning new ways of thinking and operating. They have:

- **No known solutions**: Even experts don't have ready answers
- **Complex causation**: Multiple interacting factors
- **People must do the work**: Authority figures can't solve it alone
- **Takes time**: Requires experimentation and learning
- **Requires change**: People must shift values, beliefs, or behaviors

#### Examples from Outbreak Response

- Getting communities to trust public health authorities
- Convincing people to change cultural burial practices
- Building collaboration between competing agencies
- Addressing health misinformation on social media
- Managing fear and stigma
- Balancing economic concerns with health measures

These challenges involve human behavior, values, culture, trust, and belief systems. No technical manual can solve them.

## The Critical Mistake: Applying Technical Solutions to Adaptive Challenges

The most common leadership failure in outbreak response is **treating an adaptive challenge as if it were a technical problem**.

::: {.callout-important}
## The Adaptive Challenge Trap

When leaders apply technical solutions to adaptive challenges, they:
- Create more procedures when the problem is trust
- Provide more information when the problem is values conflict
- Impose more authority when the problem requires ownership
- Move faster when the problem needs time for learning
:::

### A Real-World Example

**The Situation**: During an Ebola outbreak, community members continued traditional burial practices despite public health guidance that these practices spread the virus.

**Technical Problem Thinking**:
- Solution: Educate people about transmission
- Approach: More pamphlets, more announcements, stricter enforcement
- Assumption: People lack information or are being irrational
- Result: Often failed; sometimes increased resistance and distrust

**Adaptive Challenge Thinking**:
- Recognition: This involves deeply held cultural and spiritual values about honoring the dead
- Approach: Work with communities to design burial practices that respect tradition AND reduce transmission risk
- Assumption: People have legitimate values that must be honored while adapting to new realities
- Result: Communities developed "safe and dignified burials" that they owned and sustained

The difference? The adaptive approach recognized that **people needed to learn new ways of honoring their values in a changed context**. Technical information alone couldn't solve this.

## Why Adaptive Challenges Are Harder

Adaptive challenges are difficult because they require:

### 1. Loss

People must give up something familiar:
- Old ways of working
- Comfortable assumptions
- Established routines
- Aspects of identity
- Relationships or loyalties

**In outbreak response**: Asking communities to change greeting practices (no handshakes), business owners to close, or healthcare workers to trust a new coordination structure.

### 2. Learning

People must develop new capacities:
- New skills
- Different perspectives
- Alternative approaches
- Uncomfortable conversations

**In outbreak response**: Learning to communicate uncertainty, work across disciplinary silos, or engage with hostile stakeholders.

### 3. Time

Adaptive work cannot be rushed:
- Experiments fail
- Resistance emerges
- Trust builds slowly
- Understanding develops gradually

**In outbreak response**: The pressure for immediate action conflicts with the time needed for adaptive work.

### 4. Distributed Work

The people with the problem must do the work:
- Leaders can't solve it for them
- External experts can't impose solutions
- Authority figures can facilitate but not fix

**In outbreak response**: Communities must adapt their practices; agencies must change their collaboration patterns; individuals must modify behaviors.

## How to Recognize the Difference

When facing a challenge in outbreak response, ask yourself:

| Question | Technical Problem | Adaptive Challenge |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|
| Do experts agree on the solution? | Usually yes | Usually no |
| Can authority implement the solution? | Yes | No—requires buy-in |
| Do people need to change behavior or values? | No | Yes |
| Is the solution already known? | Yes | No—must be discovered |
| How long to resolve? | Days to weeks | Weeks to months |
| Who must do the work? | Experts/authorities | The people with the problem |

## Reality Check

Most outbreak response situations involve **both** technical problems **and** adaptive challenges.

The art is recognizing which type you're dealing with at any given moment—and responding accordingly.
:::

## The Mix: Most Situations Contain Both

Consider: **Implementing a new vaccine during an outbreak**

**Technical problems**:
- Procurement and logistics (supply chain)
- Cold chain management
- Training vaccinators
- Setting up vaccination sites
- Recording doses administered

**Adaptive challenges**:
- Building vaccine confidence in skeptical communities
- Addressing concerns about new technology
- Deciding priority groups when demand exceeds supply
- Managing fear and misinformation
- Coordinating across competing health authorities
- Balancing speed with equity

A leader must address **both**. The mistake is thinking that solving the technical problems will automatically solve the adaptive challenges.

## Reflective Exercise: Your Experience

Think about a challenging situation you've faced in outbreak response (or another crisis):

::: {.callout-note}
## Reflection Questions

1. **Describe the situation briefly.**
   What was the challenge you faced?

2. **What aspects were technical problems?**
   What could be solved with existing expertise and procedures?

3. **What aspects were adaptive challenges?**
   What required people to change their thinking, behavior, or values?

4. **How did you initially approach it?**
   Did you treat it as technical, adaptive, or both?

5. **With hindsight, what do you see now?**
   Would you approach it differently knowing the technical/adaptive distinction?
:::

## Leading Through Adaptive Challenges

If adaptive challenges can't be solved with authority and expertise alone, how do you lead through them?

### 1. Get on the Balcony

Heifetz uses the metaphor of a dance floor and balcony:
- **On the dance floor**: You're in the action, responding to immediate pressures
- **On the balcony**: You step back to see patterns, dynamics, and what's really happening

**Practice**: Regularly create space to reflect. Ask: "What's really going on here? What's the adaptive work?"

### 2. Identify the Adaptive Challenge

Name what's really happening:
- What needs to change?
- Who needs to learn?
- What losses are people facing?
- What values are in conflict?

**Practice**: "The real challenge here isn't the lack of a protocol; it's that teams from different agencies don't trust each other to follow protocols."

### 3. Regulate Distress

Adaptive work creates discomfort. Too much distress and people shut down. Too little and they don't feel the need to change.

**Your role**: Keep distress within a productive zone
- Acknowledge the difficulty
- Provide some structure and direction
- Allow controlled experimentation
- Recognize small wins

**Practice**: "This is hard and uncomfortable. We're learning as we go. Let's try this approach and adjust based on what we learn."

### 4. Give the Work Back

Resist the urge to solve adaptive challenges for people:
- Ask questions instead of providing answers
- Create space for experimentation
- Support learning rather than directing action
- Build ownership rather than imposing solutions

**Practice**: Instead of "Here's how you should engage the community," ask "What do you think the community needs to hear from us? What have you seen work?"

### 5. Protect Voices of Leadership from Below

Often the people closest to the problem see what needs to change—but may lack authority:
- Community members
- Frontline workers
- Junior staff
- Affected populations

**Your role**: Create space for these voices; protect people who speak difficult truths.

**Practice**: "I'm hearing concern from the field team that our approach isn't working. Let's listen to what they're seeing."

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Declaring Victory Too Soon

You've addressed the technical problems and think you're done.

**Reality**: The adaptive work is just beginning.

### Pitfall 2: Trying to Speed Up Adaptive Work

You're frustrated that change isn't happening faster.

**Reality**: Adaptive work requires time for learning and adjustment. Pressure to move faster often backfires.

### Pitfall 3: Avoiding the Adaptive Challenge

Technical problems feel more manageable, so you focus there.

**Reality**: The adaptive challenge won't go away because you're busy with technical work.

### Pitfall 4: Personalizing the Resistance

People resist change and you take it personally or see them as "difficult."

**Reality**: Resistance is often about the loss people are facing. Understanding the resistance is part of diagnosing the adaptive challenge.

## Case Study: Contact Tracing Across Jurisdictions

**Scenario**: A disease outbreak spans multiple health jurisdictions. Each jurisdiction has its own contact tracing system, protocols, and reporting structures. Cases are being missed at jurisdiction boundaries.

**If treated as purely technical**:
- Create a unified database
- Write a memorandum of understanding
- Train everyone on the new system
- Set reporting deadlines

**Why this isn't enough**:
- Jurisdictions protect their autonomy (adaptive challenge: letting go of control)
- Different jurisdictions have different priorities (adaptive challenge: negotiating shared values)
- Staff are loyal to their own organization (adaptive challenge: building cross-boundary identity)
- Data sharing raises privacy concerns (adaptive challenge: balancing transparency with protection)
- Past conflicts create distrust (adaptive challenge: building trust across history)

**Adaptive leadership approach**:
1. **Get on the balcony**: Recognize this is about territory, identity, and trust, not just systems
2. **Identify the challenge**: "We need to learn to work as one team across boundaries"
3. **Regulate distress**: Start with low-stakes collaboration; build trust gradually
4. **Give the work back**: Let jurisdictions design the collaboration structure together
5. **Protect voices**: Ensure frontline tracers (who see the problems) can speak to leadership

**Outcome**: The technical solutions (database, MOU, training) still happen, but they're built on adaptive work that addresses the real challenges.

## Practical Application

In your next week of outbreak response work:

### Diagnose One Challenge

Choose a frustrating situation you're facing:

1. List the **technical aspects**: What can be solved with expertise and authority?
2. List the **adaptive aspects**: What requires people to change or learn?
3. Identify: Have you been treating an adaptive challenge as a technical problem?

### Adjust Your Approach

For the adaptive aspects:

1. **Get perspective**: Step back and observe the patterns
2. **Name it**: What's the real challenge beneath the surface?
3. **Create space**: How can you slow down enough for learning?
4. **Ask questions**: Instead of providing solutions, what questions could you ask?
5. **Build ownership**: Who needs to be part of designing the solution?

## Conclusion: Two Types of Leadership Work

Understanding the difference between technical problems and adaptive challenges transforms your leadership:

**For technical problems**:
- Bring expertise
- Make decisions
- Implement solutions
- Move quickly
- Provide answers

**For adaptive challenges**:
- Create space for learning
- Ask powerful questions
- Facilitate experimentation
- Be patient with process
- Protect difficult conversations

Both are essential. **The wisdom is knowing which type of work the situation requires.**

In Session 1, we learned that leadership means different things to different people. In this session, we've learned that leadership requires different approaches for different types of challenges.

The most effective outbreak response leaders develop **flexibility**: they can shift between solving technical problems and facilitating adaptive work, depending on what the situation requires.

## Remember

Technical expertise is necessary but not sufficient for outbreak response leadership. The hardest work—the adaptive challenges—requires a different kind of leadership: one that mobilizes people to do difficult work together.
:::

## Looking Ahead

In the next session, we'll explore how to lead when you don't have all the answers—a common reality in outbreak response that connects directly to adaptive challenges.

## Action Items

Before the next session:

1. **Identify three challenges** in your current work:
   - Label each as primarily technical, primarily adaptive, or mixed

2. **For one adaptive challenge**:
   - What losses are people facing?
   - What learning is required?
   - Who needs to do the work?

3. **Experiment with one adaptive leadership practice**:
   - Ask questions instead of giving answers, OR
   - Give the work back to the people with the problem, OR
   - Create space for a difficult conversation

4. **Reflect on the results**:
   - What happened when you tried the adaptive approach?
   - What did you learn?
   - What was uncomfortable?
