# Person-Centered Leading

## The Theory Behind Person-Centered Leading

At the heart of person-centered leadership is the recognition:

**It is persons who act.**

Each person brings unique traits—ways of thinking, communicating, deciding, and influencing. These traits shape how they respond to situations, how they work with others, and how they lead. People work as actors in the outbreak response drama, each bringing their particular strengths, preferences, and patterns to their role.

**Understanding these traits—both in yourself and in others—is is important for leadership.**

When you understand:
- **Your own traits**: You can leverage your strengths, manage your blind spots.
- **Others' traits**: You can communicate more effectively, build stronger teams, and adapt your approach to bring out the best in each person

Person-centered leading recognizes that **influencing these traits—helping people develop, adapt, and grow—is a core leadership responsibility.**

In outbreak response, where you work with diverse teams under pressure, this understanding becomes critical. The epidemiologist, the clinician, the community leader, and the logistics coordinator all bring different traits. Your effectiveness as a leader depends on your ability to understand these differences and work with them, not against them.

## What You Should Do

**Understand Yourself**
- Identify your natural traits, preferences, and patterns
- Recognize your strengths and potential blind spots
- Know how you typically respond under stress

**Work on Yourself**
- Develop flexibility in your approaches
- Strengthen areas where you're less naturally skilled
- Build self-awareness through reflection and feedback

**Understand Others**
- Learn to recognize different traits in team members
- Appreciate that different is not deficient
- See diversity of traits as a team strength

**Use Methods to Do That**
- Apply frameworks and tools that reveal traits
- Practice observing patterns in yourself and others
- Seek structured ways to understand differences

## Part 1: Influence Style Indicators

One powerful framework for understanding person-centered leadership is the **Influence Style Indicator** (ISI), developed by Discovery Learning International.

### What Are Influence Style Indicators?

The Influence Style Indicator is a framework that helps you understand **how you naturally try to influence others**—and how others try to influence you.

Influence is at the heart of leadership. In outbreak response, you're constantly influencing:
- Team members to adopt new protocols
- Partners to coordinate their efforts
- Communities to trust public health guidance
- Decision-makers to allocate resources

But here's the key insight: **People influence in fundamentally different ways.**

The ISI identifies these different influence styles, helping you:
1. Understand your natural influence approach
2. Recognize when your style is effective (and when it's not)
3. Adapt your approach to different people and situations
4. Build teams with complementary influence strengths

### The Four Influence Styles

The ISI identifies four primary styles of influence. Each style has distinct characteristics, strengths, and potential limitations.

#### 1. Rationalizing

**Core approach**: Influencing through logic, data, and reason

**How it sounds**:
- "Let me walk you through the data..."
- "The evidence shows that..."
- "Logically, if we do X, then Y will result..."
- "Here are the facts we need to consider..."

**Strengths in outbreak response**:
- Excellent for technical decision-making
- Builds credibility through evidence
- Appeals to scientifically-minded team members
- Effective in situations requiring objective analysis

**Potential limitations**:
- May underestimate the role of emotions and values
- Can seem cold or disconnected in crisis situations
- May lose influence when data is incomplete or ambiguous
- Might miss the "human factor" in adoption of recommendations

**When it's most effective**:
- Making evidence-based protocol decisions
- Presenting to technical audiences
- Justifying resource allocation
- Explaining epidemiological trends

**Watch out for**:
- Over-relying on data when communities need emotional connection
- Analysis paralysis when quick decisions are needed
- Dismissing concerns that can't be quantified

#### 2. Asserting

**Core approach**: Influencing through confidence, decisiveness, and clear direction

**How it sounds**:
- "Here's what we need to do..."
- "The decision is made; let's execute..."
- "I need this done by tomorrow..."
- "This is the priority right now..."

**Strengths in outbreak response**:
- Provides clarity in chaos
- Enables rapid decision-making
- Inspires confidence through decisiveness
- Cuts through ambiguity and delay

**Potential limitations**:
- May shut down input from others
- Can damage psychological safety if overused
- Might miss important information that others have
- Risk of making wrong decisions quickly

**When it's most effective**:
- Emergency situations requiring immediate action
- When team needs clear direction
- Breaking through indecision or conflict
- Establishing non-negotiable priorities

**Watch out for**:
- Using assertion when the situation actually requires collaboration
- Steamrolling over adaptive challenges that need collective work
- Damaging relationships by being too directive
- Missing the wisdom in the room by deciding too quickly

#### 3. Negotiating

**Core approach**: Influencing through finding common ground, compromise, and mutual benefit

**How it sounds**:
- "What if we tried this approach..."
- "How can we find a solution that works for everyone?"
- "Let's explore the trade-offs..."
- "I'll support your priority if you'll support mine..."

**Strengths in outbreak response**:
- Builds buy-in across diverse stakeholders
- Finds workable solutions in complex political environments
- Maintains relationships while moving forward
- Balances competing interests

**Potential limitations**:
- Can be slow when speed is essential
- Might compromise on issues that shouldn't be compromised
- Risk of "splitting the difference" when one approach is clearly better
- May be seen as lacking conviction

**When it's most effective**:
- Multi-stakeholder coordination
- Resource allocation across competing needs
- Building partnerships across organizations
- Navigating political dynamics

**Watch out for**:
- Negotiating when you should be asserting (e.g., safety protocols)
- Compromise that dilutes effectiveness
- Endless discussions when decisions need to be made
- Appearing unprincipled if you compromise too much

#### 4. Inspiring

**Core approach**: Influencing through vision, values, and emotional connection

**How it sounds**:
- "Imagine what we could achieve if..."
- "This matters because..."
- "Think about the families we'll protect..."
- "We're part of something larger than ourselves..."

**Strengths in outbreak response**:
- Motivates teams during difficult, sustained efforts
- Connects technical work to meaningful purpose
- Builds commitment beyond compliance
- Appeals to values and identity

**Potential limitations**:
- May seem impractical or overly idealistic
- Can lose credibility if not backed by action
- Might not resonate with very analytical team members
- Risk of manipulation if not authentic

**When it's most effective**:
- Building team morale during long responses
- Connecting with communities about behavior change
- Recruiting volunteers or partners
- Sustaining effort when people are exhausted

**Watch out for**:
- Inspiring words without concrete action
- Using emotional appeal to avoid hard decisions
- Losing credibility with repeated inspirational speeches
- Neglecting the practical details that make vision real

### Understanding Your Influence Profile

Most people have a **primary influence style**—the approach they use most naturally, especially under pressure. But effective leaders can access multiple styles depending on the situation.

::: {.callout-note}
## Influence Style Flexibility

The goal isn't to change your natural style. It's to:
1. **Understand your default approach** and when it serves you well
2. **Recognize when your style isn't working** in a given situation
3. **Develop flexibility** to draw on other styles when needed
4. **Build teams** with complementary influence styles
:::

### Influence Styles in Action: An Outbreak Response Scenario

**Situation**: Your team needs to convince a community to accept a vaccination campaign after previous public health interventions were perceived as disrespectful.

**How each style might approach it**:

**Rationalizing**:
"Let me show you the data on disease burden and vaccine efficacy. The numbers clearly demonstrate that vaccination will reduce cases by 70-80%. Here's the epidemiological model..."

*Risk*: Community doesn't trust the data or doesn't want to hear statistics—they want to know they'll be respected.

**Asserting**:
"We're implementing the vaccination campaign starting Monday. Here's the schedule. Everyone needs to be vaccinated to stop the outbreak."

*Risk*: Community feels imposed upon again, resistance increases, trust decreases further.

**Negotiating**:
"We understand there were issues with previous programs. What would make this campaign work better for the community? What concerns do you have? How can we address them while still achieving our public health goals?"

*Strength*: Creates space for community input, finds workable compromises.
*Risk*: Might take longer than the outbreak timeline allows.

**Inspiring**:
"This is about protecting the children in your community—your neighbors' children, your own children. Together, we can create a healthy future for this community. We respect your leadership and want to partner with you in this important work."

*Strength*: Connects to values, builds motivation, shows respect.
*Risk*: Might not address specific practical concerns or past grievances.

**Most effective approach**? Probably a combination:
- **Inspiring**: Connect to shared values and show respect
- **Negotiating**: Address specific community concerns and design the campaign together
- **Rationalizing**: Provide clear information when requested
- **Asserting**: Be clear about timeline constraints and non-negotiables (e.g., cold chain requirements)

### Recognizing Influence Styles in Others

Understanding influence styles isn't just about yourself—it's about recognizing how others operate.

**Listen for clues**:

When a team member says:
- "Show me the data" → Likely values rationalizing
- "What's the bottom line?" → May appreciate asserting
- "How can we all win here?" → Probably comfortable with negotiating
- "Why does this matter?" → May be moved by inspiring

**Adapt your approach**:

If you're trying to influence someone who values **rationalizing**:
- Lead with evidence and logic
- Provide data to support your position
- Explain cause-and-effect relationships
- Be prepared to answer analytical questions

If you're trying to influence someone who values **asserting**:
- Be direct and clear
- State your position confidently
- Focus on the decision and action needed
- Respect their time by being concise

If you're trying to influence someone who values **negotiating**:
- Acknowledge different perspectives
- Show willingness to find common ground
- Explore options together
- Demonstrate you're listening to their concerns

If you're trying to influence someone who values **inspiring**:
- Connect to purpose and values
- Paint a vision of the desired outcome
- Show how this aligns with their ideals
- Appeal to the meaningful impact

### Building Complementary Teams

Different outbreak response situations require different influence styles. The most effective teams have members who can draw on all four styles.

**Example team composition**:

- **Incident Commander** with strong asserting: Provides clear direction
- **Epidemiologist** with strong rationalizing: Grounds decisions in data
- **Community Liaison** with strong inspiring: Builds trust and motivation
- **Operations Coordinator** with strong negotiating: Balances competing resource needs

When you build teams, think about:
- What influence styles are naturally present?
- What styles might be missing?
- How can team members complement each other?
- Who might need to stretch into less comfortable styles?

### Practical Applications for Outbreak Response Leaders

#### 1. Self-Awareness Practice

Over the next week, notice:
- Which influence style do you use most naturally?
- When does your style work well?
- When do you get frustrated? (Often indicates your style isn't working)
- What style do you avoid or underuse?

#### 2. Situational Analysis

Before important influence moments, ask:
- What does this situation require? (Quick decision? Building consensus? Motivating action?)
- What influence style would be most effective?
- Is that my natural style, or do I need to adapt?

#### 3. Team Observations

Look at your outbreak response team:
- What influence styles dominate?
- What styles are underrepresented?
- Are there conflicts that might be style clashes?
- How can you leverage style diversity?

#### 4. Communication Adaptations

For each key stakeholder, consider:
- What influence style do they seem to value?
- How can I adapt my communication to resonate with them?
- What would make my message more compelling to their style?

### Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

#### Pitfall 1: Overusing Your Dominant Style

**Problem**: You default to your comfortable style even when it's not working.

**Solution**: Notice when you're not getting through. Ask yourself: "What other influence approach might work here?"

#### Pitfall 2: Judging Other Styles as Wrong

**Problem**: You see your style as "right" and others' as ineffective or annoying.

**Solution**: Recognize that all styles have value in different situations. Different ≠ deficient.

#### Pitfall 3: Faking a Style Inauthentically

**Problem**: You try to use a non-natural style but come across as insincere.

**Solution**: Adapt while staying authentic. You don't have to abandon your natural style—just flex toward others when needed.

#### Pitfall 4: Ignoring Style Mismatches

**Problem**: Team conflicts arise from style differences but are treated as personality clashes.

**Solution**: Name the style difference. "I think we're approaching this differently—I'm focused on the data, and you're focused on how we'll get buy-in. We need both."

## Reflective Exercise: Understanding Your Influence Style

::: {.callout-note}
## Reflection Questions

**Identifying Your Natural Style**:

1. Think of a recent situation where you successfully influenced someone. What approach did you use?
   - Did you use data and logic? (Rationalizing)
   - Did you provide clear direction? (Asserting)
   - Did you find common ground? (Negotiating)
   - Did you appeal to values or vision? (Inspiring)

2. When you're under pressure or stressed, which influence style do you default to?

3. Which style feels most comfortable and natural to you? Which feels most awkward or difficult?

**Understanding Your Effectiveness**:

4. Think of a time when your influence attempt failed. Looking back:
   - What style were you using?
   - What style might have been more effective?
   - What was the mismatch between your approach and what the situation required?

5. What influence style do you tend to overuse? What style do you underuse?

**Developing Flexibility**:

6. What influence style would stretch you the most to develop?

7. Think of an upcoming influence challenge. What style does this situation require? Is that natural for you, or will you need to adapt?

## Case Study: Influence Styles in a Response Team

**Scenario**: A measles outbreak response team is struggling with coordination.

**The Team**:

- **Dr. Sarah** (Epidemiologist, strong rationalizing): Wants every decision backed by data and models. Frustrated when team makes "emotional" decisions.

- **Marcus** (Incident Commander, strong asserting): Wants quick decisions and clear action. Impatient with long discussions.

- **Amira** (Community Liaison, strong inspiring): Focuses on building trust and connecting to community values. Concerned that team is too focused on logistics and not enough on relationships.

- **Jordan** (Logistics Coordinator, strong negotiating): Tries to find compromises between competing demands. Frustrated when others won't budge.

**The Conflict**:

The team is debating vaccination strategy:
- **Sarah** wants to target high-risk age groups based on epidemiological data
- **Marcus** wants to start vaccinating immediately in the most affected neighborhood
- **Amira** wants to start with community leaders to build trust
- **Jordan** wants to split vaccines across all approaches

**The Problem**: Each person is using their natural influence style, talking past each other.

- Sarah presents more data (rationalizing)
- Marcus gets more directive (asserting)
- Amira makes more emotional appeals (inspiring)
- Jordan proposes more compromises (negotiating)

**The Breakthrough**: The team facilitator names what's happening:

"We're all trying to influence each other, but we're using different approaches. Sarah, you're appealing to data. Marcus, you're providing clear direction. Amira, you're connecting to values. Jordan, you're finding middle ground. All of these perspectives have merit. What if we stepped back and asked: What does THIS specific situation require? When do we need data? When do we need decisiveness? When do we need community trust? When do we need balance?"

**The Resolution**:

The team realizes they need a sequenced approach:
1. **Rationalizing first**: Review the epidemiological data to understand risk
2. **Inspiring second**: Engage with community leaders to understand values and build trust
3. **Negotiating third**: Design an approach that balances data and community input
4. **Asserting fourth**: Make a clear decision and execute

Each influence style has its moment. The team's diversity becomes a strength when they understand how to use it.

## Part 2: Social Identity Mapping

Beyond understanding how we influence others, person-centered leadership requires understanding **who we are**—and who the people we lead understand themselves to be.

### Understanding Social Identity

Social identity theory recognizes that each person's sense of self is shaped by multiple identities. These identities influence:
- How we see the world
- What we value
- How we relate to others
- How we show up in leadership situations
- What threatens us and what energizes us

In outbreak response, you work with people whose identities may be very different from your own. A national epidemiologist and a village health worker may have overlapping professional identities but very different cultural, geographic, and organizational identities. Understanding these identities—including your own—is essential for effective person-centered leadership.

### The Three Layers of Identity

Social identity mapping recognizes three layers of identity:

#### 1. Core Identity

**Core identity** comprises the fundamental aspects of who you are—the most central elements of your sense of self.

These are the identities that feel most essential, most non-negotiable. When core identities are threatened or disrespected, people experience this as an attack on their fundamental being.

**Examples**:
- For some people, their religious or spiritual identity is core
- For others, their identity as a parent or caregiver is central
- For some, their professional identity (scientist, healer, leader) is fundamental
- For others, their cultural or ethnic identity is at the core

**In outbreak response**:

When you ask people to change behaviors that are tied to core identity, you're asking them to do something profoundly difficult. For example:
- Asking someone to change burial practices when their core identity is tied to honoring ancestors
- Asking a clinician to follow a protocol that conflicts with their core identity as a healer who uses their judgment
- Asking community leaders to defer to external experts when their core identity is as protectors of their community

**Leadership implication**: Recognize when you're bumping up against core identity. You cannot ignore or steamroll core identity. You must work with it, honor it, and help people find ways to express core identity while adapting to new realities.

#### 2. Given Identities

**Given identities** are assigned to you by society, circumstance, or birth. You didn't choose them, but they profoundly shape how you experience the world and how others respond to you.

**Examples of given identities**:
- **Race and ethnicity**: How society categorizes you based on physical appearance or ancestry
- **Nationality**: Where you were born or hold citizenship
- **Age and generation**: When you were born and what life experiences that generation shares
- **Gender** (for some people; for others it's more complex)
- **Family background**: The socioeconomic status, culture, and experiences you were born into
- **Ability/disability**: Physical, cognitive, or mental health conditions you were born with or acquired
- **First language**: The language(s) you learned first

**Why given identities matter**:

Given identities come with:
- **Different experiences**: A person who has experienced discrimination based on a given identity sees the world differently than someone who hasn't
- **Different access to power**: Some given identities grant privilege and access; others create barriers
- **Different levels of trust**: People may trust or distrust you based on given identities before you've said a word

**In outbreak response**:

Given identities create dynamics that affect leadership:
- A young female epidemiologist may be dismissed by older male community leaders, regardless of her expertise
- An international responder may be distrusted based on national identity or historical context
- A person from an affected community may have insights that an outsider misses—and may also have blind spots that an outsider sees

**Example**:

During an Ebola response, international responders (given identity: foreign nationality, often race) were initially distrusted in some communities because of historical experiences with colonialism and exploitation. Local responders (given identity: from the affected community) were trusted more readily but sometimes lacked technical resources. Effective leadership recognized these dynamics and deliberately partnered locals and internationals in ways that leveraged the trust of locals and the resources of internationals.

**Leadership implication**:
- Recognize your own given identities and the privilege or barriers they create
- Don't assume your experience is universal
- Be aware that given identities affect how your leadership is received
- Build teams that include diverse given identities to expand perspective and reach

#### 3. Chosen Identities

**Chosen identities** are aspects of yourself that you have selected, developed, or joined. While circumstance may have influenced these choices, you had agency in adopting them.

**Examples of chosen identities**:
- **Professional identity**: Epidemiologist, nurse, social worker, journalist
- **Organizational affiliation**: WHO, Ministry of Health, Médecins Sans Frontières, local NGO
- **Political or ideological alignment**: How you identify politically or philosophically
- **Religious or spiritual practice** (when chosen rather than inherited)
- **Hobbies and interests**: Runner, musician, activist
- **Roles you've taken on**: Parent (if you chose to become one), volunteer, mentor
- **Educational background**: The degrees and training you pursued

**Why chosen identities matter**:

Chosen identities represent:
- **Commitments** you've made
- **Values** you've aligned with
- **Communities** you've joined
- **Expertise** you've developed

Because they're chosen, they often feel particularly meaningful. People are proud of chosen identities—but can also feel defensive when they're challenged.

**In outbreak response**:

Chosen professional identities shape how people approach problems:
- An epidemiologist's chosen identity may emphasize data-driven decision-making
- A community organizer's chosen identity may emphasize participation and empowerment
- A physician's chosen identity may emphasize individual patient care
- A public health official's chosen identity may emphasize population-level impact

These different professional identities can create productive tension—or unproductive conflict—depending on whether differences are recognized and navigated skillfully.

**Example**:

In a response team, tension arose between:
- **WHO staff** (organizational identity: global, technically excellent, protocol-driven)
- **Local NGO staff** (organizational identity: community-rooted, relationally focused, flexible)

Each group saw their organizational identity as superior. WHO staff thought local NGO was too loose and unprofessional. Local NGO thought WHO was too rigid and disconnected from reality.

The breakthrough came when the team mapped their organizational identities explicitly and recognized: "We've chosen different organizational homes because we value different things. WHO's protocols provide consistency. The local NGO's flexibility provides responsiveness. We need both. How can we stop competing and start complementing?"

**Leadership implication**:
- Recognize that chosen identities carry commitments and values
- Don't dismiss chosen identities ("You're being too academic," "You're too focused on process")
- Help people see how different chosen identities complement each other
- Create space for people to honor their chosen professional identities while also adapting

### Mapping Your Own Social Identities

To lead in a person-centered way, start by understanding your own identities.

::: {.callout-note}
## Exercise: Your Social Identity Map

**Core Identity**:
- What 2-3 aspects of your identity feel most fundamental to who you are?
- If these were threatened, you would feel threatened at your core

**Given Identities**:
- What identities were assigned to you by birth, society, or circumstance?
- Race/ethnicity:
- Nationality:
- Age/generation:
- Gender:
- Family background:
- Other:

**Chosen Identities**:
- What identities have you selected or developed?
- Professional identity:
- Organizational affiliation:
- Educational background:
- Roles you've chosen:
- Other:

**Reflection**:
- Which of your given identities have created privilege or access for you?
- Which have created barriers?
- How do your chosen identities align with your core identity?
- Are there tensions between different identities you hold?
:::

### How Identities Show Up in Leadership

#### Identity and Authority

Your identities affect whether people grant you authority:
- **Some identities grant automatic authority** in certain contexts (e.g., medical degree in health contexts, age in some cultures)
- **Some identities require you to earn authority** that others receive automatically
- **Some identity combinations create contradictions** (e.g., young + expert, female + authoritative in some contexts)

**Question for reflection**: Which of your identities make leadership easier? Which make it harder? How have you learned to navigate this?

#### Identity and Perspective

Your identities shape what you see and what you miss:
- **Given identities shape life experience**: A person who has faced discrimination sees power dynamics that others miss
- **Chosen professional identities shape problem framing**: An epidemiologist and a social worker see different aspects of the same outbreak
- **Core identities shape what you consider non-negotiable**: What feels obvious to you may be your core identity speaking

**Leadership implication**: Recognize that your perspective is shaped by your identities—it's not the only perspective. Build teams with different identity combinations to expand what the team can see.

#### Identity Threat in Outbreak Response

Outbreak response frequently creates **identity threats**—situations where people's identities are challenged or disrespected:

**Examples**:
- **Core identity threat**: "Your traditional practices are dangerous" (implies: your culture is bad)
- **Given identity threat**: Speaking to local leaders in a patronizing tone because of age, gender, or nationality
- **Chosen identity threat**: "Your professional judgment doesn't matter; just follow the protocol"

When identity is threatened, people become defensive, resistant, or disengaged—even if the technical content of what you're saying is correct.

**Alternative approach: Identity-honoring leadership**:
- **Honor core identity**: "Your community's burial practices show deep respect for the deceased. How can we preserve that respect while also reducing transmission risk?"
- **Honor given identity**: "As someone from this community, you understand dynamics we're missing. What should we know?"
- **Honor chosen identity**: "You're an experienced clinician. Given that expertise, what do you think about this protocol? How could we adapt it to work in your setting?"

### Using Social Identity Mapping with Your Team

#### Exercise: Team Identity Mapping

Facilitate a conversation where team members share:
1. **One given identity** that shapes how they see the outbreak response
2. **One chosen identity** (usually professional) that influences their approach
3. **How these identities affect** their perspective and priorities

**Example from a real team**:

**Maria** (Field Epidemiologist):
- **Given identity**: Grew up in poverty; first in family to attend university
- **How it shapes her**: "I'm very aware of barriers to accessing health services. When we say 'people should come to vaccination sites,' I think about all the reasons they can't—transport costs, lost wages, childcare. I push the team to bring services to communities."

**Dr. Ahmed** (Incident Commander):
- **Chosen identity**: Military background before public health
- **How it shapes him**: "My military training makes me focus on clear command structures and rapid execution. I value speed and decisiveness. Sometimes the team tells me I need to slow down and listen more."

**Lin** (Community Liaison):
- **Core identity**: Buddhist practice and belief in interconnection
- **How it shapes her**: "I start from the assumption that we're all connected. The community isn't 'them' and we're not 'us.' We're all in this together. That shapes how I build relationships."

**Impact**: After sharing, the team understood each other's perspectives better. They stopped seeing differences as problems and started seeing them as complementary strengths.

#### Benefits of Team Identity Mapping

1. **Reduces unproductive conflict**: "We're not in conflict because someone is wrong—we're seeing things differently because of our identities."
2. **Builds empathy**: Understanding what shaped someone helps you understand them
3. **Leverages diversity**: Different identities mean different perspectives—this becomes a strength when recognized
4. **Creates psychological safety**: Sharing identities builds connection and trust

### Practical Applications for Outbreak Response

#### 1. Before Community Engagement

Ask yourself:
- **What given identities do I carry** that affect how the community will perceive me?
- **How can I acknowledge these** in a way that builds trust rather than creates distance?
- **Whose identities on my team** might help bridge gaps or create connection?

**Example**:
An international team partnered with local community health workers, explicitly introducing them as "colleagues from this community who are guiding us." This honored the local team members' given identity (from the community) and their chosen identity (health professional).

#### 2. In Team Conflicts

When teams are in conflict, ask:
- **Is this an identity clash?** Are different identities leading to different values or priorities?
- **Can we name the identity dynamic?** "I think we're seeing this differently partly because of our different professional backgrounds."
- **How can both identities be honored?** "We need both the epidemiological rigor you bring and the community relationships she brings."

#### 3. In Your Own Self-Awareness

Regularly reflect:
- **Which of my identities is most activated right now?** (e.g., "I'm really in 'expert' mode right now—is that what this situation needs?")
- **Is my identity creating blind spots?** (e.g., "My identity as an internationaldevelopment professional makes me focus on what's broken—am I missing local strengths?")
- **Am I honoring or threatening others' identities?** (e.g., "Did I just dismiss her input because my professional identity makes me overvalue technical expertise?")

### Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

#### Pitfall 1: Assuming Your Identity Is Neutral

**Problem**: Thinking "I'm just being objective" when actually your identities are shaping your perspective.

**Reality**: Everyone has identities. Claiming neutrality often means you're in a privileged identity that feels invisible to you.

**Solution**: Make your identities visible to yourself. Ask: "How might my [given/chosen] identity be shaping how I see this?"

#### Pitfall 2: Treating Identity as Fixed

**Problem**: Putting people in identity boxes and assuming that determines everything about them.

**Reality**: People hold multiple identities. The same person can draw on different aspects of identity in different situations.

**Solution**: Recognize identity as complex and dynamic. Ask people how they identify rather than assuming.

#### Pitfall 3: Ignoring Given Identity Dynamics

**Problem**: Pretending that power dynamics related to race, gender, nationality, etc., don't exist in your team.

**Reality**: These dynamics exist whether you acknowledge them or not. Ignoring them doesn't make them go away.

**Solution**: Create space to name dynamics when they affect the work. "I'm aware that as the only international staff member in this meeting, my opinion might carry weight it shouldn't. Please push back if you disagree."

#### Pitfall 4: Centering Your Own Identity

**Problem**: Leading as if everyone shares your identity or should aspire to it.

**Reality**: Different identities bring different strengths. Leadership isn't about everyone becoming like you.

**Solution**: Person-centered leading means adapting to others' identities, not expecting them to adapt to yours.

## Integrating Parts 1 and 2: Influence Styles and Social Identities

Understanding both influence styles (Part 1) and social identities (Part 2) gives you a richer picture of person-centered leading:

**Influence styles** help you understand **how** people try to affect others.

**Social identities** help you understand **who** people are and what shapes their perspective.

Together, they create powerful insights:
- A person's chosen professional identity might shape their influence style (e.g., scientists may favor rationalizing)
- Core identity might affect which influence styles feel authentic
- Given identities might affect whose influence is heard (e.g., asserting might work differently depending on gender in some contexts)

**Example**:

**Dr. Fatima** has:
- **Given identity**: Woman, from the affected country, younger generation
- **Chosen identity**: Epidemiologist trained in Europe, WHO staff member
- **Core identity**: Muslim, committed to serving her community
- **Natural influence style**: Rationalizing (data-driven)

Understanding these layers helps her:
- Recognize when to lead with her local identity vs. her WHO identity depending on audience
- Understand why her rationalizing style sometimes lands differently than when male colleagues use the same style
- Connect her data-driven approach to her core value of service: "I use evidence because my faith calls me to serve well, and that means using the best information available"

This self-awareness allows her to navigate complex situations skillfully rather than feeling confused about why the same approach works sometimes and not others.

## Connection to Previous Sessions

Person-centered leading builds directly on previous sessions:

**Session 1: What Does Leadership Mean to Us?**
- Different people define leadership differently partly because of their traits and influence styles
- A rationalizing person might define leadership as "making evidence-based decisions"
- An inspiring person might define it as "motivating people toward a vision"
- Understanding influence styles helps explain this diversity

**Session 2: Adaptive Challenges vs. Technical Problems**
- Technical problems can often be solved with rationalizing (data-driven solutions)
- Adaptive challenges often require inspiring (helping people change) and negotiating (finding new agreements)
- Knowing which influence style fits which type of challenge is powerful

**Session 3: Psychological Safety and Inclusion**
- Different influence styles contribute to psychological safety in different ways
- Rationalizing: Makes it safe to question assumptions and demand evidence
- Negotiating: Makes it safe to voice concerns and find common ground
- Inspiring: Makes it safe to connect emotionally and share values
- Asserting: Makes it safe to make decisions and move forward (when used wisely)
- Inclusion means valuing all influence styles, not just the dominant ones

## Looking Ahead

This session introduced two frameworks for understanding persons in leadership:
- **Part 1: Influence Style Indicators** - How people try to influence others
- **Part 2: Social Identity Mapping** - Who people are (core, given, and chosen identities)

**Future sections in person-centered leading will explore**:
- Other trait frameworks that help you understand yourself and others
- How to have developmental conversations that help people grow
- How to adapt your leadership to different personality types
- How to build self-awareness as an ongoing leadership practice

Person-centered leading is a deep topic. We've only begun. But understanding influence styles and social identities gives you a practical starting point for bringing this approach to your outbreak response leadership.

## Action Items

Before the next session:

### Part 1: Influence Styles

1. **Identify your primary influence style**:
   - Which of the four styles (rationalizing, asserting, negotiating, inspiring) feels most natural to you?
   - Ask a trusted colleague: "When I'm trying to influence you, what approach do I typically use?"

2. **Observe influence styles in action**:
   - In your next three meetings, notice what influence styles people are using
   - Notice when influence attempts succeed or fail—was it a style match or mismatch?

3. **Practice adapting your style**:
   - Choose one situation this week where your natural style might not be most effective
   - Consciously try a different influence approach
   - Reflect: What happened? What did you learn?

### Part 2: Social Identity

4. **Map your own identities**:
   - Complete the Social Identity Mapping exercise (core, given, chosen)
   - Identify which identities are most active in your leadership role
   - Reflect: How do these identities shape your perspective?

5. **Recognize an identity dynamic**:
   - Think of a recent conflict or miscommunication in your work
   - Could different identities (core, given, or chosen) have contributed to the disconnect?
   - How might naming the identity dynamic have helped?

6. **Practice identity-honoring communication**:
   - In one interaction this week, consciously honor someone's identity
   - Examples: "As someone from this community..." / "Given your expertise as a clinician..." / "I know your faith is important to you..."
   - Notice how it affects the conversation

### Integration

7. **Connect influence style and identity**:
   - How might your identities shape your natural influence style?
   - Are there situations where your identity affects whether your influence style is effective?
   - How can understanding both frameworks help you lead more skillfully?

## Remember

Leadership happens through persons—each with unique traits, influence styles, and identities.

**Influence styles** show us how people try to affect others. Understanding your natural style and developing flexibility helps you adapt to different situations and people.

**Social identities** (core, given, and chosen) shape who people are, what they value, and how they see the world. Recognizing identities—yours and others'—helps you lead with empathy and effectiveness.

Together, these frameworks aren't about putting people in boxes. They're about recognizing the beautiful diversity of how people think, communicate, and lead—and learning to work with that diversity rather than against it.

Your effectiveness as a leader grows when you develop the flexibility to influence in multiple ways while honoring the diverse identities of the people you work with.
