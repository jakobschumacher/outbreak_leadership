### Sessions Overview

**Session 1: What Does Leadership Mean to Us?**

Understanding what leadership means—to you, to your team, and in the context of outbreak response—is the foundation for everything that follows. This session explores diverse perspectives and helps you develop your personal leadership definition. Key insight: leadership means something different to each of us, and that diversity is a strength.

**Session 2: Adaptive Challenges vs. Technical Problems**

Based on Ronald Heifetz's leadership framework, this session explores the critical distinction between technical problems (which can be solved with existing expertise) and adaptive challenges (which require people to learn and change). Understanding this difference transforms how you lead during outbreaks, where the hardest challenges are often adaptive, not technical.

**Session 3: Inclusion, Belonging, and Psychological Safety**

Drawing on Amy Edmondson's research on fearless organizations, this session explores the three-level framework: diversity is a fact, inclusion is a behavior, and belonging is the emotional outcome. The session emphasizes psychological safety—the belief that you can speak up without fear—as essential for outbreak response teams working under pressure with incomplete information. Learn specific leader behaviors that build psychological safety and enable diverse teams to contribute their best work.

### About Leading in Uncertainty

Outbreak response presents unique leadership challenges:

- **Incomplete information**: Decisions must be made with limited data
- **Rapidly changing situations**: What works today may not work tomorrow
- **High stakes**: The consequences of decisions affect public health and safety
- **Diverse stakeholders**: Managing expectations across communities, governments, and organizations
- **Personal stress**: Leading while managing your own fear and uncertainty

This resource acknowledges these challenges and provides a space to explore how you can lead effectively despite them.
